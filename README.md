# AutoAimEyeTracking
One eye tracking, detecting pupil in real time using opencv and eye-haarcascade.
Uses Trishume algorithm for calculating eye's center point.
No needed to detect a face for tracking it. Our case of use is the eye being near of the camera and centered, so de the minimun size is big for us. You can tweak and try different sizes into detectMultiScale function for your convenience.
